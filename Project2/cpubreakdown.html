<h2>CPU Breakdown</h2>
<hr>
<a id = "TopofPage"></a>
<p>
     While shopping for CPUs you might come across a little bit of an information overload. So this page has been made to breakdown the key features to look for while shopping.
</p>
<p><b>
AMD vs. Intel
</b></p>
<p>
     The two main manufacturers for CPUs are AMD and Intel. Ask just about anyone with computer knowledge which one is better and the answer will almost always be Intel. 
Now this does not mean you should completely rule out AMD. In fact the lower prices on AMD chips are one major advantage they have. So if your on a tight budget, than an AMD build is probably your best bet.
 AMD used to be the front runner in the CPU world but progress in Intels manufacturing process has put them far in the lead.
However, AMD is about to release their new line of CPUs early in 2017 that are said to compete with Intels latest line. So be sure to keep up with what is going as far as new releases while doing your shopping.
You might find it more beneficial to wait a little while to get some more options.
</p>
 <p><b>
Cores vs. Clock Speed
</b></p>
<p>
     Now that you know a little more about the makers of processors, we can start to get into some of the specifications. The two main things to look for in a CPU is it's clock speed and the amount of cores it has.
 So what does this mean? Well to put it as simply as possible, the clock speed is how fast the processor runs and processes instructions and is measured in hertz (Gigahertz specifically). Cores determine how well a CPU can handle multitasking, 
A lot of newer programs utilize multiple cores to complete calculations faster. So it is often said that more cores is better than having a higher clock speed. This isn't the case. The truth is it depends on your needs.
 If you plan on doing a lot of video rendering or running a workstation build than more cores will be best (typically 8 -16), however the casual user or gamer doesn't need more than four cores.
 Again be sure to check out reviews and comparisons while shopping.
</p>
<p>
     There are plenty of other specifications that play a factor but they would be beyond the scope of a beginner and thus, this guide. Feel free to do some more research if you wish to learn more but this page has given you what you immediately need to know for your first time CPU shopping.
