Welcome!
</b></p>
<p>     Welcome to my complete computer building guide! This guide will help someone new to building computers through their first build. To begin check out the "Your PC Needs" page to help determine what you want to get out of your PC.
When you have decided what you will use the computer for, its time to shop for the parts you will need. Check out the "Parts Needed" page for help. After aquiring all the parts needed for the build its time to get started!
Use the "Steps For Building" page to start working on your dream machine!
<p><b>
Why build over buy?
</b></p>
<p>     So you may be asking the question "Why build a PC when you can buy one prebuilt?"
Well building a PC yourself is often more cost effecient, customizable, and just plain fun!
Sometimes the big box stores will charge prices for prebuilt computers that costs much more than the components of the build.
Building your own PC gives you the flexibility to build to your own specific needs, whether that is gaming, editing, home theater (HTPC), or just browsing.
With the ability to pick the quality of the parts you need, you will be able to stick to a specific budget allowing you to spend more on components you feel are more specific to what you need.
You may think it a daunting task to build a pc from scratch, but don't worry! This guide will help you through all the steps and have you well on your way to enjoying your new computer. 
It will just be that much better knowing you built it yourself!
</p> 
<p><b>
How difficult is it?
</b></p>
<p>     Well building a computer with no guide to help you can surely be confusing, but with the right instructions, anyone can build a PC. That's what this guide is here for, to give you precise, easy to follow instructions.
</p>
<p><b>
How long does it take?
</b></p>
<p>     Depending on your skill level and other factors, a build can take 1-2 days. It's more common to see a build complete within a day however, and as your skills and knowledge grow you will be building working computers within hours!
</p>
<p><b>
How do I know I'm getting the right parts?
</b></p>
<p>     Shopping for the components is quite a task. You can quickly find yourself overwhelmed with the options you have. So how do you know if you are getting the right parts? Well you have to start by asking yourself shat you will be using the PC for.
As far as looking for quality parts, make sure you check out online reviews on the parts you are looking at as well as looking up the company to see if they are reputable.
Check out the "Your PC Needs" page for more information.
</p>
<p><b>
The Dangers of Building
</b></p>
<p>     Well you will find solace in the fact that it can be very difficult to do permanent damage to your components. Besides breaking them, the most common concern is sending a static shock through any of your parts. Just make sure you are well grounded before touching any components.
You may also be prone to pokes and scrapes from sharp corners if you arent careful. Other than that just follow the steps in this guide and you will make it through alright.
