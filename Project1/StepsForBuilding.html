<p><b>
Adding the CPU and RAM to the motherboard<a id = "cpu"></a>
</b></p>
More often than not, it easier to put in the CPU and the ram on the motherboard before its put into the case.<br>
<ol>
	<li>To put in the CPU simply lift the retaining lever, insert the CPU with the corner marker facing in the correct corner on the socket then lower the retaining lever back down and lock it in place.</li>
	<li>To install the RAM you must find the RAM slots on the motherboard. If you are installing 2 sticks make sure they go in the same colored slots. </li>
	<li>You will have to push back the retaining lever, line up the notch in the RAM stick with the one in the slot and press in until the retaining lever clicks into place.</li>
</ol>
I highly recommend putting on the CPU cooler at this time as well, since its usually easier to put on outside of the case. <br>
<ol>
	<li>First you must use a pea-sized dab of thermal paste on the middle of the CPU.</li>
	<li>Most stock coolers are pretty straight forward having only to line up the divits with the holes on the motherboard and snapping them in place. After-market coolers will vary so carefully follow the instructions given with them.</li>
	<li>When the cooler is on be sure to plug the fan into the CPU fan header on the motherboard (usually right next to the socket).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>
Putting the motherboard in the case<a id = "mobo"></a>
</b></p>
Putting the motherboard in the case is one of the simpler steps to this project.<br>
<ol>
	<li>Insert the I/O panel(Just snaps int frame in the back of the case.</li>
	<li>See where the holes line up and put in stand-offs if none are preinstalled (Included with case normally). BACK OF MOTHERBOARD SHOULD NOT BE TOCHING THE CASE DIRECTLY!!
	<li>Screw in the motherboard</li>
	<li> Connect the front panel cables using the directions in the motherboard manual</li>
</ol>
<p><b>
Installing the hard drive<a id = "hdd"></a>
</b></p>
Most cases now have rail systems that make installing a hard drive a breeze.
<ol>
	<li>Insert the hard drive into the tray for the hard drive cage</li>
	<li>Slide into one of the slots in the hard drive cage</li>
	<li>Connect the SATA cable from the hard drive to the motherboard (included with the motherboard)</li>
	<li> If you have an ssd or the case doesnt have a hard drive cage you will have to find the spot for the drive and screw it in</li>
</ol>
<p><b>
Installing the power supply<a id = "psu"></a>
</b></p>
Most cases have cutouts that allow you to run cables through the otherside of the motherboard tray to make it easier to manage cables.
<ol> 
	<li>Insert the power supply with the fan facing down and screw it in with the 4 screws in the back</li>
	<li>Run the cables as neatly as posible to the back and hook up all the power connections for the components</li>
	<li>Tie up and tuck away the wires you do not use</li>
</ol>
<p><b>
Installing the graphics card<a id = "gpu"></a>
</b></p>
The graphics card is considered a plug and play, meaning there's no software necassary to get it working. It's highly recommended you install the drivers either on the disk or from the manufacturer website though.(covered in next step)
<ol>
	<li>Remove the appropriate slot covers from the back of the case so you can plug your monitor into the GPU</li>
	<li>Locate the PCIe slot on the motherboard and slid the GPU in until you here the locking mechanism click</li>
	<li>Plug in power if necassary</li>
</ol>
<p><b>
Installing the software<a id = "soft"></a>
</b></p>
Before you install the OS, you will probably be asked to set a boot drive. This is a one time thing. To do it just press *F12* while the PC is booting and find the name of your hard drive.
<ol>
	<li>Either from a flash drive or disk, install the operating system</li>
	<li>Insert the disk for the motherboard or get the drivers from the manufacturer's website and install them</li>
	<li>Insert the disk for the GPUor get the drivers from the manufacturer's website and install them</li>
	<li>Install any other software you need</li>
</ol>

<p>     You are all done! wasn't that bad right? Hopefully this guide made it pretty easy and you learned a lot on the way to your brand-new computer!!</p>
