<h2>Sleeping Sickness Lyrics</h2>
<i>by City and Colour</i>

<p>
<a id="t1"></a>I awoke, only to find my lungs empty<br>
And through the night, so it seems I'm not breathing<br>
And now my dreams, are nothing like they were meant to be<br>
And I'm breaking down, I think I'm breaking down
</p>
<p>
<a id="t2"></a>And I'm afraid, to sleep because of what haunts me<br>
Such as, living with the uncertainty<br>
That'll never find the words to say<br>
Which would completely explain, just how I'm breaking down
</p>
<p>
<a id="t3"></a>Someone come and, someone come and save my life<br>
Maybe I'll sleep when I am dead but now it's like the night is taking sides<br>
And all the worries that occupy the back of my mind<br>
Could it be, this misery will suffice
</p>
<p>
<a id="t4"></a>I've become, a simple souvenir of someone's kill<br>
Like the sea, I'm constantly changing from calm to ill<br>
Madness fills my heart and soul as if the<br>
Great divide could swallow me whole, oh how I'm breaking down
</p>
<p>
<a id="t5"></a>Someone come and, someone come and save my life<br>
Maybe I'll sleep when I am dead but now it's like the night is taking sides<br>
And all the worries that occupy the back of my mind<br>
Could it be, this misery will suffice
</p>
<p>
<a id="t6"></a>Someone come and, someone come and save my life<br>
Someone come and, someone come and save my life<br>
Someone come and, someone come and save my life<br>
Could it be, this misery will suffice
